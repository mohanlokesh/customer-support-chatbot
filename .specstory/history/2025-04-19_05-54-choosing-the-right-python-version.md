_**Assistant**_

Based on these requirements, Python 3.9-3.11 would be most suitable.

Some key dependencies with version constraints:
- Rasa 3.6.21 works best with Python 3.9-3.10
- Flask 3.1.1 requires Python 3.8+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.40 works with Python 3.8-3.12
- Streamlit 1.44.0 supports Python 3.8-3.11

Python 3.9 or 3.10 would provide the best compatibility with all packages, especially considering Rasa's requirements.
